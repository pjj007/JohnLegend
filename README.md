# JohnLegend
This is a John Legend Tour website made for E-Media B course at the USC (University of the Sunshine Coast). The assignment focuses on 
how to plan, design and build responsive and dynamic, database driven website. For this particular assignment, a random musician that is touring Australia is to be chosen and the website will revolve around this musician. This website was built as per the course assignment requirements. The main purpose of this website is just simply to do the following:
* Show the artist's tour dates
* Show related media/gallery
* Give a bit of information of the artist
* Implement the use of sending email through a form
* RWD build to support multiple devices
* Cross-Browser compatible
